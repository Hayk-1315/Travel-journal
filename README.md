# 🌍 Travel Journal

This is a simple travel journal application built with **React** as part of my learning journey.  
It displays a series of travel destinations with their locations, dates, descriptions, and links to Google Maps.  
The app renders data from a local file and includes basic components like a **Navbar** and **Card** for a clean, responsive layout.

## 🚀 Getting started

### 1️⃣ Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hayk-1315/Travel-journal.git
cd travel-journal
2️⃣ Install dependencies:
npm install

3️⃣ Run the project in development mode:
npm run watch

This will start the Webpack bundler in watch mode so it rebuilds on every change.
Open index.html in your browser to see the app.


💬 Notes:
This was an early practice project built with React and Webpack.
Although using Webpack manually is now outdated, the focus was on learning the basics of React components and working with data-driven UIs.
